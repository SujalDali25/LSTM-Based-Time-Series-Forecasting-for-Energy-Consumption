# LSTM-Based-Time-Series-Forecasting-for-Energy-Consumption
This project uses LSTM networks to forecast hourly energy consumption from AEP and DOM data. It covers data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation with visualizations. Ideal for learning time series forecasting using deep learning techniques like LSTM in a real-world energy dataset.
