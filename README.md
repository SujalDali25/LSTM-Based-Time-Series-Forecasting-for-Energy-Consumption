# 🔮 LSTM-Based Time Series Forecasting for Energy Consumption

This repository demonstrates a deep learning approach to **forecast hourly electricity consumption** using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks. The project uses historical data from two major U.S. power utilities — **AEP** and **DOM** — and provides a hands-on example of time series prediction using neural networks.

## 📝 Project Description

This project uses LSTM networks to forecast hourly energy consumption from AEP and DOM datasets. It includes data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation with visualizations. Ideal for learning time series forecasting using deep learning techniques like LSTM in a real-world energy context and compares it with RNN prediction with the same data.
